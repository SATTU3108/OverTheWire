# Level Goal: 

The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory.

# Solution: 

  * Since we got a password in the last level, we need to change the user to bandit2 now and then logging into bandit 2 with new password.
  * Now the filename has spaces in it. So directly using cat command along with the filename will not work, since it will break at the first space.
  * In order for the whole name to be used, use double quotes around the file name.

  * Again, new password has come. So will login as bandit3.
